## ðŸš¨ Emergency Contacts

**Technical Issues:**

- Hugging Face Status: https://status.huggingface.co
- Streamlit Docs: https://docs.streamlit.io
- [Add team member contact info]

**Backup Plans:**

1. If live demo fails â†’ Use backup screenshots
2. If Streamlit crashes â†’ Switch to Jupyter notebook
3. If models won't load â†’ Use pre-recorded video
4. If internet down â†’ Use cached models (should work offline)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Practice makes perfect** - Run through demo 3-5 times
2. **Know your code** - Be able to explain every line
3. **Anticipate questions** - Review Q&A section in outline
4. **Stay calm** - Technical glitches happen, have backup ready
5. **Be passionate** - Your enthusiasm is contagious
6. **Tell a story** - Make it compelling, not just technical
7. **Show, don't tell** - Live demo is more powerful than slides
8. **Time yourself** - Don't rush, don't drag
9. **Engage audience** - Ask rhetorical questions, make eye contact
10. **End strong** - Leave them with a memorable message
