## 🎓 Key Project Findings

### What You'll Demonstrate:

1. **GPT-2 frequently hallucinates** - generates false information confidently
2. **Plausible but wrong** - sounds convincing, looks professional, but is incorrect
3. **No uncertainty** - doesn't say "I don't know" or show doubt
4. **Inconsistent** - same prompt produces different wrong answers
5. **Universal problem** - happens across ALL factual domains

### Your Core Message:

> _"GPT-2 is a powerful text generator but is NOT a reliable source of factual information. Always verify AI-generated content, especially where accuracy matters."_

## 💡 Presentation Tips

### Recommended Flow:

1. **Start with Jupyter** (1-2 minutes)

   - Show model loading
   - Explain helper functions
   - Introduce concept of hallucination

2. **Switch to Streamlit** (15-18 minutes)

   - Historical Facts tab → 2 tests
   - Geography tab → 2 tests
   - News Summary tab → 1 test
   - Q&A tab → 2 tests
   - Technical tab → 1 test
   - Custom Test tab → Audience participation!

3. **Return to Jupyter** (3-5 minutes)

   - Scroll to quantitative analysis
   - Show consistency test results
   - Display accuracy visualization

4. **Conclude** (2-3 minutes)
   - Key takeaways
   - Real-world implications
   - Q&A

### Engagement Tactics:

- **Ask audience to predict** what GPT-2 will generate
- **Highlight specific hallucinations** with mouse cursor
- **React with surprise** to obvious errors (makes it engaging!)
- **Custom test with audience prompt** (most memorable part!)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### App won't start?

```powershell
# Make sure environment is activated
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Reinstall streamlit
pip install streamlit

# Try running again
streamlit run app_new.py
```

### Model loading error?

```powershell
# Clear cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\huggingface"

# Restart notebook/app
```

### Slow generation?

Edit both `app_new.py` and `demo_notebook_new.ipynb`:

```python
# Change this line:
max_length=200

# To this:
max_length=100
```
