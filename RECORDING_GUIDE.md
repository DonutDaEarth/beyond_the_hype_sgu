## 📝 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening (P1):

"This is not a live presentation. We've recorded this to ensure the highest quality demonstration of GPT-2's hallucination problem."

### Hypothesis (P2):

"GPT-2 will frequently generate plausible but factually incorrect information because it predicts word sequences rather than retrieving verified facts."

### Why GPT-2 Fails (P1):

"The model predicts words, not facts. No knowledge representation. No verification mechanism. No uncertainty awareness."

### Real-World Impact (P2):

"The danger isn't just false information—it's that the false information is so fluent and confident that humans trust it without verification."

### Conclusion (Both):

"Current language models are powerful text generators but systematically fail at factual accuracy. They should not be deployed where facts matter without human oversight."

## 🎬 RECORDING TIPS

### Before Recording:

1. **Test all demos** - Run every test case successfully
2. **Prepare slides** - Have all PowerPoint slides ready
3. **Script key points** - Write down important quotes
4. **Set up environment** - Good lighting, clear audio, clean background
5. **Have water ready** - Stay hydrated between takes

### During Recording:

1. **Multiple takes are OK** - Redo any section until perfect
2. **Speak clearly** - Enunciate, don't rush
3. **Show enthusiasm** - Energy translates through video
4. **Point to screen** - Guide viewers' attention visually
5. **Pause for effect** - Let important points sink in

### After Recording:

1. **Edit seamlessly** - Cut awkward pauses, technical issues
2. **Add visual aids** - Text overlays, arrows, highlights
3. **Balance audio** - Normalize volume between presenters
4. **Add transitions** - Professional fade-ins/fade-outs
5. **Review timing** - Ensure exactly 30:00 total

## 🎯 DEMONSTRATION SEQUENCE

### Part 1 Demo Flow:

1. **Show Streamlit app** - Explain interface
2. **Historical Facts** - WWII, Einstein (show 2 hallucinations)
3. **Geography** - Australia, Everest (show 2 hallucinations)
4. **News Summary** - Battery article (show factual changes)
5. **Q&A** - Continents, Microsoft (show confident errors)
6. **Custom Test** - Live example with audience-style prompt
7. **Code Walkthrough** - Show model loading, generation function, comparison logic

### Key Points to Emphasize:

- "Ground truth is Canberra, but GPT-2 says..."
- "The model changed 50% to [wrong number]"
- "Notice no uncertainty - confidently wrong"
- "Same prompt, different outputs - inconsistent"
- "This is the real model, unmodified, standard parameters"

## 📊 SLIDES TO PREPARE

### Part 2 Slides Needed:

1. Title slide with project name
2. Promise vs. Reality comparison
3. Research question & hypothesis
4. Model selection justification
5. Experiment design diagram
6. Metrics for failure
7. Summary of results (data/charts)
8. Why GPT-2 fails (architecture)
9. Hallucination patterns observed
10. Real-world implications (medical, legal, news, finance)
11. Revised realistic statement about AI
12. Technical solutions (RAG, fact-checking, uncertainty)
13. Policy recommendations
14. Future research directions
15. Final powerful quote
16. Thank you + GitHub link

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **DON'T:**

- Say "if this works..." (it's recorded - make it work!)
- Apologize for technical issues (edit them out!)
- Rush through sections (you have time)
- Read slides word-for-word (explain them)
- Forget to point out specific hallucinations
- Assume viewers see what you see (guide their attention)

✅ **DO:**

- Speak with confidence (you have proof!)
- Point to specific errors on screen
- React to hallucinations ("Look at this...")
- Transition smoothly between presenters
- Reference previous demonstrations
- End with a memorable conclusion
