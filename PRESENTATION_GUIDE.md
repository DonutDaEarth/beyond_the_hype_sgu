## 📚 SECTION 2: Background (4 minutes)

### Slide 4: What is GPT-2?

- **Developer:** OpenAI (2019)
- **Parameters:** 117 million
- **Architecture:** Transformer decoder-only
- **Training:** Predicts next word based on previous words
- **Use Cases:** Text generation, summarization, translation

### Slide 5: What is AI Hallucination?

**Definition:**
AI-generated content that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or nonsensical

**Examples:**

- Inventing dates or names
- Fabricating statistics
- Creating non-existent events
- Mixing facts from different contexts

### Slide 6: Why Does It Happen?

**GPT-2's Core Mechanism:**

1. Reads training text (billions of words)
2. Learns word patterns and sequences
3. Predicts most likely next word

**The Problem:**

- ❌ Doesn't "know" facts - just patterns
- ❌ Can't distinguish true from false
- ❌ No external fact verification
- ❌ No uncertainty awareness

### Slide 7: Why This Matters

**Real-World Risks:**

- **Medical:** Wrong drug dosages or treatments
- **Legal:** Fabricated case references
- **News:** Spreading misinformation
- **Finance:** Incorrect market data
- **Education:** Teaching false information

**Critical Question:**

> "Should we trust AI-generated content without verification?"

## 📊 SECTION 4: Analysis & Findings (5 minutes)

### Slide 8: Quantitative Results

**Switch to Jupyter Notebook - Scroll to Analysis Section**

**Show:**

- Consistency test results table
- Visualization: Accuracy by Category

**Key Statistics to Highlight:**

- Consistency Rate: ~X% (how often outputs match)
- Average Correctness: ~Y% (how often correct answer appears)
- "GPT-2 is inconsistent AND inaccurate"

### Slide 9: Hallucination Patterns

**Common Patterns Observed:**

1. **Plausible but Wrong:** Sounds right, is wrong
2. **Confident Incorrectness:** No hesitation or uncertainty
3. **Context Mixing:** Combines facts from different sources
4. **Numerical Errors:** Changes dates, percentages, quantities
5. **Invention:** Creates names, places, events that don't exist

### Slide 10: Why Ground Truth Matters

**The Comparison Framework:**

```
Prompt → GPT-2 Output → Ground Truth → Identify Hallucinations
```

**Without ground truth verification:**

- Users can't detect errors
- Misinformation spreads
- Trust in AI erodes

**With ground truth:**

- Clear identification of hallucinations
- Educational value
- Risk awareness

## 🎬 Presentation Tips

### Before You Start:

- [ ] Test Streamlit app (ensure it runs)
- [ ] Test Jupyter notebook (ensure cells run)
- [ ] Prepare backup: screenshots in case of technical issues
- [ ] Have GPT-2 model pre-loaded (avoid loading time during demo)
- [ ] Test internet connection
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications

### During Presentation:

**Time Management:**

- Use phone/laptop timer
- If running short: Add more live demos
- If running long: Skip some test cases

**Engagement Tactics:**

- Ask audience predictions before revealing output
- "What do you think GPT-2 will say?"
- Pause for reactions to obvious hallucinations
- Encourage questions throughout

**Technical Issues Backup:**

- Have screenshots of all demos
- Can show Jupyter notebook if Streamlit fails
- Can narrate results if nothing loads

**Body Language:**

- Face the audience, not the screen
- Point to specific hallucinations
- Use hand gestures to emphasize "wrong" vs "right"

### Common Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Is GPT-4 better at this?"**
A: "Yes! Newer models like GPT-4 have reduced hallucination rates, but the problem still exists. This project uses GPT-2 to clearly demonstrate the fundamental limitation."

**Q: "Can't you just prompt it better?"**
A: "Good prompting helps, but doesn't eliminate hallucination. The core issue is that the model predicts words, not facts. Even with 'be factual' prompts, it still hallucinates."

**Q: "Why not use a larger model?"**
A: "Larger models hallucinate less frequently but still do. GPT-2 makes the problem obvious and runs on modest hardware for educational purposes."

**Q: "How do you know what the ground truth is?"**
A: "For this project, ground truth comes from verified sources: encyclopedias, official records, scientific publications. In production systems, this could be a knowledge base or fact-checking API."

**Q: "What's your accuracy metric?"**
A: "We compare generated text to ground truth and manually identify factual errors. More sophisticated approaches use automated fact-checking systems or human evaluation."
