## 💡 KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE

### During Recording:

1. **"This is a recorded presentation"**

   - Say this in opening to set expectations
   - Allows for high-quality editing
   - Professional standard expected

2. **"GPT-2 systematically hallucinates"**

   - Not edge cases - the norm
   - Across all factual domains
   - Proven by our demonstrations

3. **"Fluency is not accuracy"**

   - Sounds convincing ≠ being correct
   - Confident ≠ reliable
   - This is the core problem

4. **"Real-world consequences"**

   - Medical misinformation
   - Legal fabrications
   - Financial errors
   - News misinformation

5. **"We must move beyond the hype"**
   - Acknowledge AI capabilities
   - Recognize clear limitations
   - Demand responsible deployment
